# FileSpider


This script crawls through the given directory and copies files and folders.

 > **Run the *fileSpider.py* script to start the program.**

## What does it do?

> - It creates a database file named "filespider.sqlite" and a log file called "dump.log"
> - It prompts the user for a password and stores the encrypted form in the database for future verification. Everytime the user has to verify.
> - It goes through the selected folder and copies all the files into the destination folder keeping the file directory structure intact
> - It keeps track of the files that are being copied so that it can skip copying those in the future

### What I plan to improve?

***

I made this to properly learn python and its several libraries. I would like to implement this in an object oriented approach.
I would also like to improve the level of security.
